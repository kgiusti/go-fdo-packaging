Distro Packages for the FIDO Device Onboard server and client tools.

This is a proof of concept. At some point this repo will be removed.

_THIS IS NOT OFFICIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE FIDO-DEVICE-ONBOARD GITHUB PROJECT_

The "official" fido-device-onboard sources are here:

https://github.com/fido-device-onboard

The RPMs are configured to build from the source found at my personal fork:
